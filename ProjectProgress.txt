Project Plan

Phase 1:
    Step 1. Design the registers R0 to R15, PC, IR, Y, Z, MAR, HI, and LO (see Figures 1 and 2).
    - Sixteen 32 bit registers R0 - R16 for Mini SRC
    - Two dedicated 32 bit instruction registers HI and LO for holding multiplication and division
    - One 32 bit instruction register IR
    - One 32 bit program counter PC that points to the next instruction after execution
    - Y register is a 32 bit temp register that holds ALU input A
    - Z is a 64 bit and holds the result of the 

    Step 2. Design the bidirectional Bus (Figure 3) and connect the registers that you designed in Step 1 to the Bus.

    Step 3. Design the MDR unit (Figure 4) and connect it to the BUS. Leave the rest of the Memory Subsystem
    (connection to the memory chip) for Phase 2.

    Step 4. Design your ALU. Start with simple ALU operations such as logical AND, etc. Then, design the more
    involved operations such as ADD/SUB, MUL, and DIV circuitry. Finally, design the rest of the ALU
    operations.
        • For the multiplication unit, you are to design your own 32x32 Booth algorithm with bit-pair
        recoding of multiplier.
        • You are welcome to design and simulate any other advanced design techniques that you
        learned in class for a bonus mark. 

Notes for Phase 1:
    - Verify submodules are setup correctly. (1)
        - Git
        - ChatGPT
        - Drive
        
    - Look at how to connect everything to the Bus. (2)
    - Design the MDR unit. (3)
    - Design ALU (4)
